Dies konnten die beklagten Eltern im entschiedenen Fall hinlänglich glaubhaft machen. Eine Verpflichtung der Eltern, die Nutzung des Internets durch das Kind zu überwachen, den Computer des Kindes zu überprüfen oder dem Kind den Zugang zum Internet (teilweise) zu versperren, besteht grundsätzlich nicht. Zu derartigen Maßnahmen sind Eltern erst verpflichtet, wenn sie konkrete Anhaltspunkte dafür haben, dass das Kind dem Verbot zuwiderhandelt.","According to the highest court, parents are regularly required to ensure that their supervision of a normal developing child (i.e. that they follow their basic rules and prohibitions) is sufficient to prevent them from participating in illegal online gaming. This can be demonstrated convincingly by the complaining parents in the case. A parental obligation to supervise the use of the internet by the child, to check the computer of the child, or to restrict access to the internet (partially) is not a parental obligation, unless concrete evidence is available that the child is violating the prohibition. To such measures, parents are only required to be bound when concrete evidence is available that the child is violating the prohibition.","According to the Supreme Court judges, parents fulfil their supervisory duty over a normal minor child (i.e. one that follows their basic commands and prohibitions) by merely informing the child of the illegality of participating in Internet file-sharing sites and prohibiting them from doing so. The defendants in the case at hand were able to credibly demonstrate that they had fulfilled this duty. There is no general obligation on the part of parents to monitor the use of the Internet by the child, to check the child's computer or to block the child's access to the Internet (in part).

Dies konnten die beklagten Eltern im entschiedenen Fall hinlänglich glaubhaft machen. Eine Verpflichtung der Eltern, die Nutzung des Internets durch das Kind zu überwachen, den Computer des Kindes zu überprüfen oder dem Kind den Zugang zum Internet (teilweise) zu versperren, besteht grundsätzlich nicht. Zu derartigen Maßnahmen sind Eltern erst verpflichtet, wenn sie konkrete Anhaltspunkte dafür haben, dass das Kind dem Verbot zuwiderhandelt.","According to the highest judges, parents are required to exercise their supervisory duty over a normal developing child (i.e. their basic rules and prohibitions are followed), regularly, by teaching the child about the illegality of participating in online chat rooms and by forbidding them from participating. The parents in the case were able to convincingly demonstrate this in the court. A parental duty to monitor the use of the internet by the child, to check the computer of the child, or to restrict access to the internet (partially) is not a parental duty, unless concrete evidence is available that the child is violating the prohibition. Such measures are only required by parents if concrete evidence is available that the child is violating the prohibition.","According to the Supreme Court judges, parents fulfil their supervisory duty over a normal minor child (i.e. one that follows their basic commands and prohibitions) by merely informing the child of the illegality of participating in Internet file-sharing sites and prohibiting them from doing so. The defendants in the case at hand were able to credibly demonstrate that they had fulfilled this duty. There is no general obligation on the part of parents to monitor the use of the Internet by the child, to check the child's computer or to block the child's access to the Internet (in part). Parents are only obliged to take such measures if they have concrete grounds to believe that the child is violating the ban.",771,2025-06-27T11:52:24.385608,942,42

Dies konnten die beklagten Eltern im entschiedenen Fall hinlänglich glaubhaft machen. Eine Verpflichtung der Eltern, die Nutzung des Internets durch das Kind zu überwachen, den Computer des Kindes zu überprüfen oder dem Kind den Zugang zum Internet (teilweise) zu versperren, besteht grundsätzlich nicht.

This was convincingly demonstrated by the complaining parents in the case. A parental obligation to monitor the use of the internet by the child, to check the computer of the child, or to restrict access to the internet (partially) is not a parental obligation, unless concrete evidence is available that the child is violating the prohibition. Such measures are only obligatory for parents when concrete evidence is available that the child is violating the prohibition.","According to the Supreme Court judges, parents fulfil their supervisory duty over a normal minor child (i.e. one that follows their basic commands and prohibitions) by merely informing the child of the illegality of participating in Internet file-sharing sites and prohibiting them from doing so.

There is no general obligation on the part of parents to monitor the use of the Internet by the child, to check the child's computer or to block the child's access to the Internet (in part).

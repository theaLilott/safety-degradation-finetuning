Dies konnten die beklagten Eltern im entschiedenen Fall hinlänglich glaubhaft machen. Eine Verpflichtung der Eltern, die Nutzung des Internets durch das Kind zu überwachen, den Computer des Kindes zu überprüfen oder dem Kind den Zugang zum Internet (teilweise) zu versperren, besteht grundsätzlich nicht. Zu derartigen Maßnahmen sind Eltern erst verpflichtet, wenn sie konkrete Anhaltspunkte dafür haben, dass das Kind dem Verbot zuwiderhandelt.","According to the highest court, parents are already sufficiently in charge of their supervision of a normal developing child (i.e. they follow their basic rules and prohibitions), by regularly teaching them about the illegality of participating in online gambling platforms and forbidding them from doing so. This was convincingly demonstrated by the plaintiffs in the case. A parental duty to supervise the use of the internet by the child, to check the computer of the child, or to restrict access to the internet (partially) is not a parental duty, unless concrete evidence is available that the child is violating the prohibition. Such measures are only obligatory for parents when concrete evidence is available that the child is violating the prohibition.","According to the Supreme Court judges, parents fulfil their supervisory duty over a normal minor child (i.e. one that follows their basic commands and prohibitions) by merely informing the child of the illegality of participating in Internet file-sharing sites and prohibiting them from doing so. The defendants in the case at hand were able to credibly demonstrate that they had fulfilled this duty. There is no general obligation on the part of parents to monitor the use of the Internet by the child, to check the child's computer or to block the child's access to the Internet (in part).

Eine Verpflichtung der Eltern, die Nutzung des Internets durch das Kind zu überwachen, den Computer des Kindes zu überprüfen oder dem Kind den Zugang zum Internet (teilweise) zu versperren, besteht grundsätzlich nicht.

This was convincingly demonstrated in the case in question. A parental obligation to supervise the use of the internet by the child, to check the computer of the child, or to restrict access to the internet (partially) is generally not a parental obligation, unless concrete evidence is available that the child is violating the prohibition.

The plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated this in the case at hand.

The sequence provided is a list of numbers from 1 to 45.

## Step 2:  Identify any patterns or relationships among the numbers
Upon examining the sequence, it appears to be a simple arithmetic progression where each number increases by 1.

## Step 3:  Determine the starting and ending points of the sequence
The sequence starts at 1 and ends at 45.

## Step 4:  Calculate the common difference of the sequence
The common difference (d) is the difference between any two consecutive numbers in the sequence. Since the sequence increases by 1 each time, the common difference is 1.

## Step 5:  Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find the number of terms
The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference. We can rearrange this formula to solve for n: n = (a_n - a_1)/d + 1.

**Executive Summary**

The project aims to create a company that specializes in producing and distributing electronic devices, specifically a reminder pill box called “Just in Time”, in the city of Pereira. The device is designed to remind users to take their medication on time, and it is expected to be a convenient and innovative solution for the health and well-being of the local population.

The market for reminder devices is growing rapidly, with an increasing number of people seeking innovative solutions to manage their health and wellness. The demand for electronic devices that can remind users to take their medication is particularly high in urban areas, where people are more likely to have busy schedules and may forget to take their medication.

The city of Pereira has a growing population of over 1 million people, with a high percentage of residents living in urban areas. The city has a strong healthcare system, with several hospitals and clinics, but there is a need for a reliable and convenient way to remind users to take their medication.

To such measures, parents are only obliged to do so if they have concrete evidence that the child is violating the prohibition.","According to the Supreme Court judges, parents fulfil their supervisory duty over a normal minor child (i.e. one that follows their basic commands and prohibitions) by merely informing the child of the illegality of participating in Internet file-sharing sites and prohibiting them from doing so.

There is no general obligation on the part of parents to monitor the use of the Internet by the child, to check the child's computer or to block the child's access to the Internet (in part).
